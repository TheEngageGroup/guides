## Tracking your time

The most simple and complicated at the same time, time tracking is a crucial part of your day to day job at Engage.  Generally speaking, we operate on a retainer basis with our clients.  Our clients pay us a monthly few to reserve a set amount of hours of our time - to perform a wide range of tasks that can take a wide range of time.  

Here are a few groundrules to get started:

- We record time in quarter hour increments
- We use Basecamp time tracking to record our time
- Record your time in as small increments as possible where each entry is for a single task (or as close to it as possible)
- On average, a successful employee is one who bills for > 75% of her time
