## Tracking your time

The most simple and complicated at the same time, time tracking is a crucial part of your day to day job at Engage.  Generally speaking, we operate on a retainer basis with our clients.  Our clients pay us a monthly few to reserve a set amount of hours of our time - to perform a wide range of tasks that can take a wide range of time.  

Here are a few groundrules to get started:

- We record time in quarter hour increments.
- We use Basecamp time tracking to record our time.
- Record your time in as small increments as possible where each entry is for a single task (or as close to it as possible).
- On the whole, you should target 80% of your time as billable to a job.  If you feel that you won't reach that number for the week/month you should reach out to the group right away for more work.  
- The other 20% is reserved for learning, special projects and other admin duties.
