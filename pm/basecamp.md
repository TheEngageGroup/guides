## Managing your projects with Basecamp
We manage all of our projects in Basecamp.  We find that it has enough functionality to be useful but not too much to be in the way.  

## Naming the project
Each project should have a name that is descriptive, tells you when it's due and who the work is for.

Each name should:
- Start with the client's name or acronym
- Include a brief but good description of the job
- End with the due date or planned delivery date
