## How to learn stuff

There are several opportunities to learn new techologies or get better at the ones you already know here.  Hopefully, you get the sense that learning new things is encouraged and that we really really love to play with new tech and toys.    

To that effect, we have accounts with several of the top online learning sites on the web, including:

- Lynda.com
- Codeshool
- Learn from Thoughtbot
- Frontend Masters
- Railscasts
- Tuts+

To give you some ideas, we spend a lot of time buidling html emails, writing front end code such as HTML/CSS/Javascript, and play around with frameworks like Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, SASS, jQuery, and NodeJs.

## Requesting one off and live training

While we don't have an unlmited budget for travel and live training, we do try our best to accomodate any request within reason.  We have sent employess to Lunametrics Google Analytics training, to Boston for Ruby training, to DC for numerous DMAW and DMA trainings and several others.  

It's quite simple to request training either offsite or on, simply gather the total cost for the training, including travel, food and other expenses, and submit them to your team leader.  Each training request is evaluated on a case by case basis.
