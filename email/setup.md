## Setting up a new email

When coding an email from scratch, start by:
- creating a repository in bitbucket
- reference the basecamp project if applicable
- Use the HTML Email boilerplate for the base 

## Testing

When ready to test the email, run the email through Premailer and then send your tests to Litmus.com(https://litmus.com/tests). You can automatically send the html email directly via: pmgteg.c3b417f.new@emailtests.com.
