## Know your roll

Engage has always had an atmosphere of ownership.  We try our best not to create overbearing or bearocratic rules and processes.  We respect and encourage individuality and that each one of us can have "their own way of doing things" that makes work feel less like work and more like something we care about, have a vested interest in and that we OWN.  

The guidelines set forth in this document only purpose is to do, well, guide.  Hopefully, what you get out of these documents are a strong sense of what to do when and that they help you navigate through your job.
